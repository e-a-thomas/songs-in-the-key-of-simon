It has continued to define our relationship: a deep love willing to take every chance and every step “through the fire” for each other.\nNow, looking back at almost 34 years of marriage and nearly 40 birthdays together, I see how that song perfectly captured us. We've faced challenges and embraced blessings, and built a life filled with music, laughter and love! I thank God for our three biggest blessings- Noah, Talya and Eli! It's truly wonderful to see them carrying on the music that brought us together. They are living proof of the harmony we created.\nSuresh, I love you more today than when we met on that train and my love for you continues to grow every day. I am truly so lucky to have you as my forever melody!\nHappy 60th birthday Suresh. Likus! To the song that helped start it all. I hope for many more years to celebrate together. I will always walk through the fire for you!\nLove\nMe"

It took me a while but with yours and Mr. Melvin's help, I finally got it all down on the piano and I was so excited. Partly because it was probably the hardest song I had learned at that point, but mostly because I knew you loved this song and I was so excited to show it to you, my greatest musical inspiration.\nYou have always been and will always be a huge inspiration in my music, and in my life in general, and I am forever grateful to have been blessed to have you as my dad. I look forward to many more years together where we can cook, travel and play lots and lots of music!\nHappy 60th Birthday dad. I love you so much.\nLove,\nNoah"

Since then, we have recorded so many songs with you, and it has given me one of the greatest gift:  a million memories through music.\nI am grateful every day that music is something you chose to share with us. You have always been and continue to be my role model in so many ways, when it comes to work, cooking, showing up for those that matter most to you, and most of all, music. I am so grateful to have you as my dad and my role model in all aspects of life. I love you so, so much. Happy Birthday!\nLove,\nTalya"

Watching you at the piano, deciphering chords from the tattered and much beloved Let It Be Me songbook, inspired me to play the piano for fun every day. You made music feel like it was ours, and your “band” at church camp made me so proud to have such a cool big brother.\nI carry a quiet gratitude for that. You didn’t just share songs — you shared something that shaped how music is now such a source of comfort, camaraderie and nostalgia; every familiar melody feels like a thread back to those days. Thank you for the music, the memories, and for being my Acha."

You displayed/I discovered a new/different level of your musicianship - and it was impressive! Your piano, vox and the feel/vibe of the live recorded performance (assumption) jumped out at me.

We remember how much Thomas Uncle loved his records, and it’s no surprise that some of that love found its way to you, alongside the gift of talent you already carried.\nAs a teenager, you’d often come by our place in PB, spending hours lost in music, listening through my AKG headphones. Looking back, it’s clear that those long afternoons were part of the path that led you to where you are today. We’re so glad you pursued Audio Engineering and grateful to Jibby for encouraging you toward Berklee.\nYour piano playing has grown so beautifully over the years—it’s been a joy to watch you excel and to see your passion deepen.

It’s about connection and listening, which is exactly how you move through life—bringing people together, guiding with presence more than volume. The shifts in the song, from quiet reflection to something more powerful, remind me of the balance you strike between calm and drive, between thoughtfulness and action. There’s a resilience in it too, a steady insistence that feels like your own determination to keep learning, keep building, keep growing.

I recall one such performance by Suresh.\nHe was quite young (can’t remember whether he had attained his current height at that time!). He sat at the piano, played, and sang ‘Soldier of Fortune, into a mic placed by his side. I didn’t know the full lyrics of the song myself at that time, learnt them later.. It remains on the playlist of my ultimate favourites, and I can still picture Suresh, even today, playing and singing softly that eve 🎄… (in the midst of  other older, and much louder Vadaketh male and female voices, I might add 😂). Wonder if Suresh remembers these family performances!"

Across the Atlantic, The Beach Boys were making waves with Good Vibrations” . Both Frank Sinatra and hos daughter Nancy had hits too , “Strangers in the Night’ and “These Boots are made for Walking” . I wonder if this had influence on your musical inclinations.\nBeside your talent and love music I associated you with fast cars. I remember around the mid 80s, you once drove the MG back from Sitiawan to Klang. I distinctly could hear the shrieking sound of rubber hitting the bitumen as you took a left into Jln Mengkuang. I understand the love for fast cars and speeding tickets has continued after all these years. So as contemplated my song choice , s few songs came to mind” Fast Car” (Tracy Chapman), “I’ve in love with my car” (Queen) , “Little Deuce Coupe”. But the tune I think epitomizes you on the highway is a tune form 1972, “ Highway Star” ! This heavy rock anthem hits all the high notes. My favorite version was Live in Tokyo, 1972, Obviously lots of improvisation , and I’m sure you ‘d give Jon Lord a run for his money on the organ. I remember you churning out the chords for “ Smoke on the Water” which was a popular tune with us cousins. But Highway Star showcases some amazing lead guitar from Richie Blackmore, powerful vocals Ian Gillan and Ian Paice on Drums . I read that this has been regarded as one the greatest Live rock openers ever recoded! Enjoy"

Even at 60, he’s proof that some people are born to move fast and never lose their spark.\n✨ In short:\nBecause no matter how many years go by, Suresh still has the need for speed — and this song says it loud and proud"

I remember sleep overs and church camps and inter parish games. I recall you broke the 100m race record, wow my cousin. Though I wasn't there to help but always in spirit, you and siblings pulling out the weeds in HQ.  One memory sticks in mind was in one of the plantations where your dad worked (we were young); and we liked a particular sweet wine, we took the bottle without permission and took a few swigs in the tub, don't remember the punishment or we choose to forget. We moved on to the days in Texas and back to Malaysia; every moment since, you’ve been a constant source of laughter, warmth, and strength. You always treated me like a brother, I look at your kids as my own kids, I have treated them as my own and always will. This song reminds me of that steady bond we’ve always had, the kind that doesn’t need words to feel. I know my darling cousin is always by my side, and that brings me peace and joy. Happy 60th birthday, brother. Here’s to many more years of walking through life together."

To choose one specific song that represents or symbolizes Suresh is impossible because to us he is THE music man in the “family”. All our best memories of him (aside from on the golf course) are of him and the family - especially the kids - making beautiful music in your garden in Bangalore or at one of our houses. Wherever he was there was always music, always singing, musical instruments being tinkered with, sing-a-longs, lots of laughter and always lots of love and good food!\nWe nominate: “Tambourine Man” by the Byrds as our special song for Suresh’s 60th celebrations. Why?\nFirstly, in November 1966 (when Suresh arrived to make our world as special as he does) the Byrds were top of the charts in the US so it’s only appropriate that we choose a hit song they produced in his birth year.\nSecondly, Suresh will always be our “Tambourine Man” – our music maker. In fact, we even have memories of him playing a tambourine on several occasions (as well as many other instruments)! So, we could think of no better song to celebrate him on this milestone birthday and what he represents in our lives and our memories of those wonderful days together in India.\nSo, to Suresh from us Jonesies: Happy 60th Birthday Mr Tambourine Man – may you continue to make music for many, many years to come.
